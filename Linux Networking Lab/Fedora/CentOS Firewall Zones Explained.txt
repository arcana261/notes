drop: The lowest level of trust. All incoming connections are dropped
without reply and only outgoing connections are possible.

block: Similar to the above, but instead of simply dropping connections,
incoming requests are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited or
icmp6-adm-prohibited message.

public: Represents public, untrusted networks. You don't trust other
computers but may allow selected incoming connections on a case-by-case basis.

external: External networks in the event that you are using the firewall 
as your gateway. It is configured for NAT masquerading so that your internal
network remains private but reachable.

internal: The other side of the external zone, used for the internal portion
of a gateway. The computers are fairly trustworthy and some additional
services are available.

dmz: Used for computers located in a DMZ (isolated computers that will not have
access to the rest of your network). Only certain incoming connections are allowed.

work: Used for work machines. Trust most of the computers in the network.
A few more services might be allowed.

home: A home environment. It generally implies that you trust most of the other
computers and that a few more services will be accepted.

trusted: Trust all of the machines in the network. The most open of the available
options and should be used sparingly.
