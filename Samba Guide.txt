# specifying valid/invalid users/groups
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
If a name is prefixed by an at sign (@), it is interpreted as a group nameâ€”with NIS groups searched before Unix groups. If the name is prefixed by a plus sign (+), it is interpreted as the name of a Unix group, and NIS is not searched. If the name is prefixed by an ampersand (&), it is interpreted as an NIS group name rather than as a Unix group name.
